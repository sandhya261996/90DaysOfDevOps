DevOps is a methodology which Involves practices to bridge the gap of Dev and ops team by using Open source automation build tools.
These are the articles which I refered to,

1.What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combine software Development(Dev) and IT Operations (Ops). 
It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality
DevOps combines development and operations to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes.

The DevOps methodology comprises four key principles that guide the effectiveness and efficiency of application development and deployment.

Automation of the software development lifecycle

Collaboration and communication

Continuous improvement and minimization of waste

Hyperfocus on user needs with short feedback loops.

2. What are Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure?

Automation is the ability to use technology to perform tasks with minimal human effort.

Scalability is the measure of the system's ability to increase or decrease in performance and cost in response to changes in application and system processing demands.

Infrastructure is the foundation or framework that supports a system or organization. In computing, information technology infrastructure is composed of physical and virtual resources that support the flow, storage, processing, and analysis of data.

3.Why DevOps is Important?

DevOps is important because it's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.

Top five reasons why the industry has been so quick to adopt DevOps principles.

Shorter Development Cycle and Faster Innovation.

Reduced Deployment Failures, Rollbacks and Time to Recover.

Improve Communication and Collaboration.

Increased Efficiencies

Reduced Costs and IT HeadCount.
